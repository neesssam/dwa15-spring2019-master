A framework provides a starting point for an application.

It is a skeleton of directories and files which you'll build in/upon to develop the functionality you need for *your* application.

Included in a framework are libraries that power essential web application features, such as:

+ Routing
+ Form handling and validation
+ Views/templating
+ Environment management
+ Session/cookie management
+ Database interaction and management (migrations, seeding)
+ Authentication (sign up, log in, recalling a vistor's data, etc.)
+ Testing
+ Caching
+ Localisation
+ Email
+ Scheduling (run scripts automatically)
+ Integration with 3rd party services (Facebook, Credit card processing, etc.)
+ Etc.

By working with these existing fundamentals, it frees you up to focus on the functionality of your application.

### Why use a framework
* Avoid reinventing the wheel
* Work with vetted code
* Build projects that are more universally understood and documented

### Challenges of working with a framework
* Initial investment in learning the framework
* Keeping up with the evolution of the framework

(These challenges are not unique to frameworks)


## Choosing a web framework
Popular frameworks across different languages:
+ PHP: [Laravel](http://laravel.com), [Symfony](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=1&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=0ahUKEwims5n1t6XSAhVo1oMKHU1GBLIQFggcMAA&url=https%3A%2F%2Fsymfony.com%2F&usg=AFQjCNHlB9fKEXEpuS-cpl0ow5IdK-Jm_Q)
+ Ruby: [Rails](http://rubyonrails.org)
+ Python: [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com), [Flask](http://flask.pocoo.org)
+ Java: [Spring](https://spring.io)
+ JavaScript (Node.js): [Express](http://expressjs.com)

Points of reference:
+ [Wikipedia: Comparison of web frameworks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_web_frameworks#PHP)
+ [Google Trends: Laravel, Symfony, Django, Ruby on Rails, Express JS](https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?cat=32&q=Laravel,symfony,django,ruby%20on%20rails,express%20js)

__Framework of choice for this course: [Laravel](http://laravel.com)__

What makes Laravel so popular?
+ Coincided with PHP's early 2000's renaissance
+ Learned from what other frameworks (Rails, Symfony) got right
+ Active, modern, polished
+ Great documentation
+ Strong community, accessible support
+ Strong partnerships and ecosystem e.g. [Laracasts](https://laracasts.com), [Forge](https://forge.laravel.com/), [Envoyer](https://envoyer.io)
+ Lower learning curve
+ Expressive code (aka [Syntactic sugar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syntactic_sugar))
