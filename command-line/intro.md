# Introduction

## What is the Command Line?
The **Command Line Interface (CLI)** is a means of interacting with your computer via text commands. While it seems that the CLI is archaic compared to GUIs (Graphical User Interfaces) it's actually a very powerful method for interacting with files and programs.

The application where you type your commands (and see any results of those commands) is called a *shell*. There are different types of shells, but the most common is the **Bash shell** which is what Linux and Mac systems use.

On Macs, Bash shell is accessed via an included application called **Terminal**.

Windows systems include the limited **Command Prompt** application, which has nowhere near the power of Bash. Windows also has **PowerShell**, but the commands are different than what is used in the Bash shell.

Given this, Windows users are going to use a console emulator called **Cmder** which will allow you to *mostly* replicate anything you'd do in a Bash shell.

In the following docs, we'll cover Terminal and Cmder in more details.




## Terminology
People use different terms when referring to a Command Line Interface - *bash*, *shell*, *terminal*, *command line*, etc. For the sake of consistency we'll use the term *Command Line* or *CL* for short. 

Unless otherwise specified, when referring to Command Line we mean Terminal on Mac and Cmder on Windows.
