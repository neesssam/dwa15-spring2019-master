# Migrations

## Important configuration preface for XAMPP users 
The charset Laravel uses by default is not compatible with the version of MySQL XAMPP currently ships with.

To fix this, in `/app/Providers/AppServiceProvider.php` update the `boot` method adding the following Schema line:

```php
public function boot()
{
    \Schema::defaultStringLength(191);
}
```

This will fix the problem, but it will limit your string (`VARCHAR`) fields to a max of 191. This should be sufficient in most cases, but if it's not, you can switch to a `TEXT` field.

If you do not complete this step, you will get the following error when complete the steps described below:

```
SQLSTATE[42000]: Syntax error or access violation: 1071 Specified key was too long; max key length is 767 bytes (SQL: alter table `users` add unique `users_email_unique`(`email`))
```

## Migrations

>> “Migrations are like version control for your database” -<https://laravel.com/docs/migrations>

With your application's local database created and your connection to that database confirmed, it's time to build your tables.

Rather than building tables with raw SQL queries or using a tool like phpMyAdmin, we'll use Laravel migrations.

__Migrations are classes that describe alterations to your database&mdash; whether it be adding tables, dropping tables, adding new columns to tables, etc.__

The benefits of managing your database with migrations include...

+ The migration files are tracked in version control so you have a history of changes over time.
+ Any collaborating developer working on your app can quickly create their own local database for the app by running the migrations.
+ Similarly, when changes to the database structure are introduced, any collaborating developers can run migrations to bring their databases up to date.

**Before proceeding, use phpMyAdmin to delete the `books` table you created when reading the [*Databases Primer*](/laravel/db-primer.md) notes.** We'll be recreating this table via a migration.

## Generate a new migration file
Artisan has several commands to help with migrations.

First, we'll prompt Artisan to generate a new migration file which we'll use to build the `books` table.
```bash
$ php artisan make:migration create_books_table
```

After you run the above command, navigate to `/database/migrations/` where you should see a new file that's named something like `2018_11_07_163222_create_books_table.php`. This file contains some starting code to create a table called `books`, which it extrapolated from the migration name we used.

While browsing `/database/migrations/` you'll also see 2 pre-existing migrations that come with Laravel by default: `create_users_table` and `create_password_resets_table`. These tables support Laravel's user authentication features, which will be discussed more at a later date.

Note that each migration filename is prefixed with a unique timestamp&mdash; this ensures migrations are run in the same order in which they were created. Also, this is one time where it's okay to break the convention of making sure a PHP's class name exactly matches the file name.


## Complete your first migration
When looking at your newly created books migration file, and you should see something like this:
```php
<?php

use Illuminate\Support\Facades\Schema;
use Illuminate\Database\Schema\Blueprint;
use Illuminate\Database\Migrations\Migration;

class CreateBooksTable extends Migration
{
    /**
     * Run the migrations.
     *
     * @return void
     */
    public function up()
    {
        Schema::create('books', function (Blueprint $table) {
            $table->bigIncrements('id');
            $table->timestamps();
        });
    }

    /**
     * Reverse the migrations.
     *
     * @return void
     */
    public function down()
    {
        Schema::dropIfExists('books');
    }
}
```

Every generated migration has this boilerplate code with a `up` and `down` method.

+ In the `up` method you'll describe some change to the database (adding a new table, adding fields to a table, etc.).
+ In the `down` method you can reverse any changes made in the `up` method. 


## Design the books table
Before writing any code in the `up` method, we have to decide what columns the table will need, and what MySQL data type each column in the table should be.

To do this, we'll refer to the plan we came up with in the [*Database primer*](/laravel/db-primer.md) notes:

<img src='http://making-the-internet.s3.amazonaws.com/laravel-books-table-design@2x.png' style='max-width:380px; width:100%' alt='books table design'>

With the `books` table design in mind, it's time to write the migration code that will create this table.

## up - Build the table
Modify the `up` method so it looks like this:

```php
public function up()
{
    Schema::create('books', function (Blueprint $table) {
        # Create a Primary, Auto-Incrementing column named `id`
        $table->bigIncrements('id');

        # This generates two columns: `created_at` and `updated_at` to
        # keep track of changes to a row
        $table->timestamps();

        # The rest of the columns...
        $table->string('title');
        $table->string('author')->nullable(); # Example of a column modifier
        $table->year('published_year');
        $table->string('cover_url');
        $table->string('purchase_url');
    });
}
```

Note how the Laravel `Schema` class is used to create the `books` table.

The above code includes comments for the `Schema` methods we're using, but be sure to read the [Schema Documentation](http://laravel.com/docs/migrations#creating-tables) for full details.



## down - Drop the table
The &ldquo;undo&rdquo; action for creating a new table is simple&mdash; just drop the table:

```php
public function down()
{
    Schema::dropIfExists('books');
}
```



## Run your migrations
When you've completed writing the code for your migration, you'll use Artisan to run it:

```bash
$ php artisan migrate
```

Example output:
```bash
Migration table created successfully.
Migrated:  2014_10_12_000000_create_users_table
Migrated:  2014_10_12_100000_create_password_resets_table
Migrated:  2018_11_07_163222_create_books_table
```

FYI: The first time you run `php artisan migrate` it will create a `migrations` table which will be used to keep track of what migrations you've run.

That should do the trick. Examine your new `books` table in phpMyAdmin to make sure it matches the design you were aiming for.

__Moving forward, you should not make *any* structural changes to your database tables via phpMyAdmin. phpMyAdmin should now only be used to view tables and data. Any structural changes to tables need to be made with migrations. If you make changes via phpMyAdmin, your database/tables will be out of sync with your migrations.__


## migrate:fresh
Getting your migrations right the first time can be challenging, especially if you're starting a new project with several new tables. You may forget columns you need or change your mind about the data type and modifiers for a given column. There may also be problems in your migration files that cause a migration to fail partway through, leaving you with an incomplete database.

Given this, there's an easy way to &ldquo;blank slate&rdquo; your database and start over with the following Artisan command:
```bash
$ php artisan migrate:fresh
```

This will drop all your tables and then run your migrations again (presumably after you've edited them to correct whatever problem existed).

The `migrate:fresh` command is useful when working locally, or in the early stages of a project when you don't have real data being entered into a production database. When a project is released into the real-world though, you don't want to run `php artisan migrate:fresh` on production since it will clear out all your real-world data.




## Altering tables
Once a table has been created and used in a production setting, any future changes to that table should also be made via a migration.

For example, let's imagine down the road you wanted to add a `page_count` column to the books table. In that situation, you'd do the following (you don't have to do this now since this is purely hypothetical):

```bash
$ php artisan make:migration add_page_count_column_to_books_table
```

In the resulting migration, your up method would look something like this:
```php
public function up() {
    Schema::table('books', function (Blueprint $table) {
        $table->integer('page_count');
    });
}
```

And your down method would look something like this:
```php
public function down() {
    Schema::table('books', function (Blueprint $table) {
        $table->dropColumn('page_count');
    });
}
```

When you next run `php artisan migrate`, it would recognize this new migration that has not been run, and it would run it, altering your `books` table.

Using migrations in this way effectively creates a version control system for your database tables, allowing you to manage changes over time and across different environments.

In this course, we don't need to worry about these kind of alteration migrations because we're not dealing with real data. Given that, it's more straightforward to just make edits to your existing &ldquo;create table&rdquo; migrations and re-run them.
