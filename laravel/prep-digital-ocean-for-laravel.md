# Prep DigitalOcean for Laravel
With your Laravel application up and running locally, you now need to deploy it on your production server.

Before deploying, though, you need to do a few updates on your DigitalOcean server so it's set up with the necessary components that Laravel needs to run.

In these notes, we'll do the following:

1. Enable a swap file for more memory
2. Install Composer
3. Install some necessary modules and enable `mod_rewrite`

Tip: This note set includes some complex command line commands, each prefixed with a brief explanation of what the command does. To break down any one particular command to learn more, paste the command into <https://explainshell.com>.

All of the following commands are to be run on your DigitalOcean server, so the first thing you want to do is SSH into your DigitalOcean server (`ssh root@your.do.ip.address`), then proceed...

## Enable a swap file for more memory
Composer can be memory intensive, so we'll want to configure our low-memory DigitalOcean droplets to use a swap file.

>> "Swap is an area on a hard drive that has been designated as a place where the operating system can temporarily store data that it can no longer hold in RAM." -[ref](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-add-swap-on-ubuntu-14-04)

To configure a swap file, run through the following commands.

First, create the swap file:

```xml
$ sudo fallocate -l 4G /swapfile
```

Next, adjust permissions on the resulting swap file so it isn't readable by anyone besides root:

```
$ sudo chmod 600 /swapfile
```

Next, tell the system to set up the swap space:

```xml
$ sudo mkswap /swapfile
```

Next, enable the swap space:

```
$ sudo swapon /swapfile
```

Finally, we want to make it so the server always enables this swap space, even after a reboot. To do this, open `/etc/fstab` with nano:

```
$ sudo nano /etc/fstab
```

...and paste in the following line at the end:

```
/swapfile   none    swap    sw    0   0
```

Save your changes (`ctrl` + `x`, then `y`, then *Enter*).

__Confirm it worked:__
You can confirm your swap file with the following command:

```
$ sudo swapon -s
```

Expected output:

```xml
Filename                Type        Size    Used    Priority
/swapfile               file        4194300 0       -2
```


## Install Composer
Move into your bin directory where you'll install Composer:

```bash
$ cd /usr/local/bin
```

Use cURL to download the Composer installer and run it with PHP:

```bash
$ curl -sS https://getcomposer.org/installer | sudo php
```

Rename the resulting `composer.phar` executable  to `composer` so it's convenient to invoke:

```bash
$ sudo mv composer.phar composer
```

Test it's working:

```bash
$ composer
```

See a list of Composer commands? Good, you're ready to move to the next step...


## Install/update necessary modules
Next, there are a few modules we need to install on the server in order for Laravel to work. 

To do this, we'll use `apt-get`, a command line utility for managing packages on Ubuntu systems (which our Droplets run on).

Run the following commands, one at a time. Follow the instructions to hit `Enter` or `Y` (yes) when prompted.

First, specify a new repository `apt-get` can download software packages from. The repository we're adding is [ppa:ondrej/php](https://launchpad.net/~ondrej/+archive/ubuntu/php), the primary source for PHP-related packages.

```bash
$ sudo add-apt-repository ppa:ondrej/php
```

Next, run `apt-get` to get the latest packages from your apt-get repositories (including your newly added one, `ppa:ondrej/php`)

```bash
$ sudo apt-get update
```

Now that everything is updated, we'll install the necessary modules:
```
$ sudo apt-get install php7.2-mbstring zip unzip
```

Next, Laravel requires Apache's `mod_rewrite` for URL routing (a topic we'll cover in future lectures). To enable this module, run the following command:

```xml
$ sudo a2enmod rewrite
```

Finally, to make all these changes take effect, restart Apache:
```xml
$ service apache2 restart
```

## Server setup complete!
At this point, you DigitalOcean Droplet has everything it needs to run a Laravel app. You're ready to move on to the next steps of deploying.
