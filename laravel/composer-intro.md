# Composer intro

## What is a dependency?
Dependencies are outside code packages that a project may utilize (i.e. they depend on it).

Examples:
+ `Form.php` is a server-side PHP dependency
+ *jQuery* is a client-side JavaScript dependency
+ *Bootstrap* is a client-side CSS dependency

Frameworks like Laravel require many dependencies, and so it is built using **dependency management software** called **Composer**.

## What is Composer?
[Composer](https://getcomposer.org) is a **dependency manager** program for PHP. Rather than manually downloading or referencing code packages like you might with the above examples, you can specify in a configuration file what packages your application needs. Composer will then read this config file and download/update the appropriate software as needed.

For example, here's the dependency configuration for a new Laravel project:
```json
"require": {
    "php": "^7.1.3",
    "fideloper/proxy": "^4.0",
    "laravel/framework": "5.8.*",
    "laravel/tinker": "^1.0"
},
"require-dev": {
    "beyondcode/laravel-dump-server": "^1.0",
    "filp/whoops": "^2.0",
    "fzaninotto/faker": "^1.4",
    "mockery/mockery": "^1.0",
    "nunomaduro/collision": "^2.0",
    "phpunit/phpunit": "^7.5"
},
```

The full library of packages available for management via Composer are found via [Packagist](http://packagist.org).

(Dependency management is not unique to PHP - other examples include Node's *NPM* and Ruby's *Bundler*.)

Like Git, Composer is a __command line program__ (installation instructions in the notes that follow).

## Composer = server-side packages
While there are some client-side packages available via Packagist/Composer, we will only use it to manage our __server-side, PHP-based packages__.

If you choose to use client-side packages in your projects (like jQuery, Bootstrap, etc.) you should manually download them to your project or link them from a CDN. 

Dependency management for client-side assets is outside the scope of this course. 


## Tangential feature of Composer: Autoloading
[Autoloading](http://php.net/manual/en/language.oop5.autoload.php) allows you to access classes in your application without having to explicitly include the class file.

Instead, you can provide a map for your application where it will look for classes and load them, on-demand, as needed.

With autoloading, you no longer have to do something like this:
```php
require 'Form.php';

use DWA\Form;
$form = new Form;
```

Instead, your application can find the class for you, so you only need to do this:

```php
use DWA\Form;
$form = new Form;
```

It seems trivial in this small example, but it's a very useful feature to have as the complexity of your application grows and with it, your usage of classes.

In addition to managing packages, Composer also builds and maintains a class map for your application, allowing you to harness auto-loading.

You don't have to worry about using/understanding auto-loading right now, just know that when we use it, it's being powered by Composer.
